# AREWA-DS-PROJECT
As part of the Arewa data science getting started with python, this repository project showcases various techniques for generating and visualizing data using Python libraries. It demonstrates how to utilize popular libraries like Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create meaningful visualizations.  

## **Overview**  
The purpose of this repository is to provide examples of generating synthetic data and visualizing it through different chart types, ranging from basic plots to advanced interactive visualizations. It serves as a resource for data enthusiasts, students, and professionals looking to improve their skills in data visualization using Python.  

## **Features**  
- **Data Generation**: Techniques for creating random datasets using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.  
- **Visualizations**: Comprehensive examples of visualizations including:  
  - Line Plots  
  - Scatter Plots  
  - Bar Charts  
  - Box Plots  
  - Heatmaps  
  - Pie Charts  
  - 3D Scatter Plots  
  - Histograms with KDE (Kernel Density Estimate)  
 
- **Customization**: Demonstrates how to customize plot aesthetics such as titles, labels, colors, and styles.  

## **Getting Started**  
To run the code and reproduce the visualizations, follow these steps:   
Ensure you have latest version of Python installed on your system. You will also need the following Python libraries:  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Plotly  

### **Installation**  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git  
   cd your-repository-name  
   ```  
2. Set up a virtual environment:  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate # For Linux/Mac  
   venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows  
   ```  
3. Install the required packages:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## **Usage**  
Each notebook (`.ipynb`) in this repository focuses on a specific visualization technique. Open the notebooks in Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook to run the examples and customize them for your needs.  

### Example Notebooks:  
- `line_plot.ipynb`: Creating and interpreting line plots.  
- `scatter_plot.ipynb`: Generating scatter plots with Seaborn and Plotly.  
- `bar_chart.ipynb`: Visualizing categorical data with bar charts.  
- `heatmap.ipynb`: Understanding correlations using heatmaps.  
- `3d_scatter_plot.ipynb`: Visualizing multidimensional data in 3D space.  

## **Visual Examples**  
Here are examples of the types of plots youâ€™ll find in this repository:  
- **Line Plot**    
- **Scatter Plot**   
- **Heatmap**
